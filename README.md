# Project-Deleton
This script is designed as a **scambaiting tool** for those who want to fight back against scammers who may have stolen or gained access to your personal data.

### Why this script exists:

* **Scammers often collect your private files and information to exploit or intimidate you.**

* If you’re a **scambaiter** (someone who plays tricks on scammers), this script lets you send a strong message back by **overwriting targeted files with a warning message**.

* Instead of simply deleting files, this script replaces the contents of important files with a **clear, visible warning:**

  > *"You are a thief. This device has been locked down."*

* This causes a psychological impact on scammers: they see every file they stole, but **cannot access the original data anymore**.

* It’s like a nightmare for them — **worse than deleting files silently**, because they face the constant reminder every time they try to open any stolen document or image.

### How it works:

* The script scans your selected drives or folders for common file types (.txt, .docx, .xlsx, .pdf, images, etc.).
* It then **overwrites the content** of each file with the warning message.
* The original data is lost, but scammers are forced to confront the fact their theft is useless.
* Drives or folders that do not exist are skipped automatically, so it runs smoothly without interruption.

### Use responsibly:

* This tool is meant for **emergency situations** and for users aware of the consequences — data overwritten by this script **cannot be recovered**.
* Only run this if you are certain your files are compromised and you want to **take a stand against scammers**.
* Always keep backups of important data elsewhere to avoid accidental loss.
* If you find an executable version of this tool in the releases, **do NOT run it on your own PC unless you have a full backup** of your important files.
